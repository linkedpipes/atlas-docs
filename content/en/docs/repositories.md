The entire project is developed in several repositories.

 - [Atlas](https://github.com/mff-uk/atlas) - the core tool that simplifies the work for the specification editor, data publisher and data consumer by integrating other tools for the toolset.
 - [Dataspecer tools](https://github.com/mff-uk/dataspecer) - enables the specification editor to create interoperable data specifications supporting various data formats while preserving mappings of compliant data to existing ontologies and vocabularies.
 - [The MM tools](https://gitlab.mff.cuni.cz/contosp) - multi-model data modeling and transformations built around the categorical representation to enable users to do cross-model querying or evolution management.
